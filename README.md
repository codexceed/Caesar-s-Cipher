Summary:
A GUI based implementation of the classic cipher text technique called the Caesar's Cipher. The input text box takes in the text and encrypts
it using the offset key value. The bottom text box shows the output. To check if the app ran correctly, we can put the output text inot the 
input box again with the same offset value used to encrypt in the first place and retrieve the original text by pressing decrypt button.
